I have chosen three research questions to complete using visuals and narrative text. I chose datasets I found on wikipedia that show the population of each country. I chose to limit to maximum fifteen countries for each research question, so the visuals would not be cluttered. I concluded that China and India have the highest population by a large margin. United States had the largest GDP by a large margin and didnâ€™t even have the largest population count. As for the correlation between population size and gold medals, there is none.
